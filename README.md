# Parcel Fontawesome Tree Shaking Repro

Parcel's tree shaking does not work with Font Awesome.

The autogenerated dist folder should only have a the icons listed in `src/index.js`, but it has _all_ the icons. (I included the dist folder in the repo so you can easily see for yourself.)

The JavaScript snippet is taken from a [functional tree-shaking example](https://github.com/mlwilkerson/fa5-webpack4-demo) demonstrating tree-shaking with Webpack.

To confirm, inspect the built files in `dist`. If you search for `f0f4`, the unicode for the `faCoffee` icon, you SHOULD NOT find it, because it was not referenced in the source in `src/index.js` and therefore eliminated from the production bundle. However, you will indeed find it in the bundle.
